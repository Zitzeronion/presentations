# Lattice Boltzmann in the wild

[Presentation](https://zitzeronion.github.io/presentations/) for the [DANSIS 25-year Anniversary symposium ](https://dansis.dk/seminar/2023-anniversary-symposium/).
The idea is to show that the **lattice Boltzmann method** is a viable alternative for many fluid simulations.
Introducing the concept, thus deriving macroscopic transport equations from the Boltzmann equation and showing results from [myself](https://github.com/Zitzeronion/Swalbe.jl), [larger open source projects](https://palabos.unige.ch/) and [PowerFLOW](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/powerflow/).
